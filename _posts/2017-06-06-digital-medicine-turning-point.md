A few items of note that leads me to believe we may be at the turning point for digital medicine:

[FDA Approves](https://www.genomeweb.com/molecular-diagnostics/fda-approves-first-drug-tumors-biomarker-indication) first drug based on the genomic features in a cancer patients' tumors, instead of where the tumor occurs in their bodies.

[Mary Meeker's Internet Trends](http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends) has an entire section on digital health. A decade or two back many of the Sand Hill VC firms threw out their life scienced partners because it was taking too long to monetize any investments in this space. Seems the tide may be turning. For a more detailed view into this listen to [Vinod Khosla's](https://blog.color.com/full-transcript-chrissy-farr-interviews-vinod-khosla-on-sequenced-42d354bdfc12) views on medicine and how the future diagnosticians are in the math department at Stanford and Harvard's medical schools.

[Udi Manber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udi_Manber) has joined UCSF's Medical School. Before this he spent 9 years at Google where he ran search (yes, that search).

For a more comprehensive discussion on how health may change in the future with the patient in control I highly reccomend reading [The Patient Will See You Now](https://www.amazon.com/Patient-Will-See-You-Now/dp/0465054749)
