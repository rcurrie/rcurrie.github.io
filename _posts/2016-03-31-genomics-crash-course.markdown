To kick start my genomics education I've been working my way through the following:

# Books
[Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters](http://www.amazon.com/Genome-The-Autobiography-Species-Chapters/dp/0060894083) 

[The Language of Life: DNA and the Revolution in Personalized Medicine](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003100UQU)

The hacker news quest for the grand unified web node reactive deep framework seems trivial and pointless against the complexity and diversity of DNA.

[Herding Hemingway's Cats: Understanding how our genes work](http://www.amazon.com/Herding-Hemingways-Cats-Understanding-Bloomsbury-ebook/dp/B015RKFCPK)

So we don't really know anything at all it turns out...perfect, so that means there's plenty left to do!

[The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature](http://www.amazon.com/The-Red-Queen-Evolution-Nature/dp/0060556579)

Do I tell my kids now that the birds and the bees talk I had with them was hopelessly simplistic and misleading?

# Textbooks
[Human Molecular Genetics, Fourth Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Human-Molecular-Genetics-Fourth-Edition/dp/0815341490)

Suggested by David Haussler to fill in some of the biology. I can't believe I'm alive after reading the first 3rd of this...

# Online Courses
[Coursera Bioinformatics Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics) which follows an interactive text book [Bioinformatics Algorithms, An Active Learning Approach](http://bioinformaticsalgorithms.com/). The coding exercises can be graded directly via the [bioinformatics textbook track](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track) on Rosalind or in the Coursera course directly. Using ipython/jupyter makes it super fun to work through these programming exercises. I'm now addicted to the dopamine (see above textbook) jolt when the Rosalind page turns green on successful submission.

# Podcasts
[The Naked Genetics Podcast](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/podcasts/genetics/)

Hosted by the author of Herding Hemingway's cats (see above).

[Genetics in Medicine Genepod](http://www.nature.com/gim/podcast/index.html)

Byte sized coverage from [ACMG](https://www.acmg.net/)
